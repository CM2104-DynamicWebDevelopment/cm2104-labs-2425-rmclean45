Note from Kane - Just a heads up, my vscode was incorrectly linked to github, so in the contributor's section it shows that I havent added anything since we were last in uni. I have been commiting under my name (shown in the commit history section) but the email was set up wrong so it doesnt show up as my account that made the commits but rather a duplicate account with the same name. Should be fixed as of 10/12 but anything before will be under the other me.
